## Summary of Additional Recommendations

- Consider ordering an MRI to rule out central causes of vertigo.
- Evaluate for orthostatic hypotension with a tilt table test.
- Check for vestibular function with electronystagmography (ENG) or videonystagmography (VNG).

## Things to Consider

- Further questions: Any recent head trauma? Any history of migraines?
- Medication interactions: Review HRT interactions with prescribed medications.
- Preventive care: Ensure patient is up-to-date with routine health screenings.

## PRIMED Model Analysis

### P: 3–4 Probable Diagnoses
1. **Labyrinthitis**
   - **Confidence %**: 70%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Acute onset of dizziness, room spinning, ear buzzing, no recent viral illness.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No ear pain or discharge.
2. **Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)**
   - **Confidence %**: 60%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Room spinning, dizziness, no hearing loss.
   - **Opposing Findings**: Continuous symptoms rather than episodic.
3. **Vestibular Migraine**
   - **Confidence %**: 50%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Dizziness, room spinning, no recent viral illness.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No history of migraines mentioned.
4. **Meniere’s Disease**
   - **Confidence %**: 40%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Dizziness, ear buzzing.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No hearing loss, no episodic nature.

### R: Red Flag Conditions
- Stroke
- Brain tumor
- Multiple sclerosis

### I: Important Often-Missed Conditions
- Orthostatic hypotension
- Acoustic neuroma

### M: Masquerades
- Anxiety disorders
- Hypoglycemia

### E: Patient Expectations
- Relief from dizziness and nausea.
- Understanding the cause of symptoms.

### D: Diagnostic Clusters
- Dizziness, room spinning, ear buzzing, unsteady gait.

## Most Likely Diagnosis
- **Labyrinthitis**
- **Confidence %**: 70%
- **Rationale**: The acute onset of dizziness, room spinning, and ear buzzing without recent viral illness or ear pain/discharge strongly suggests labyrinthitis.

## Recommendations for Further Diagnostic Steps

1. **MRI (Non-invasive)**
   - **Urgency**: Moderate
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: Rule out central causes of vertigo.
   - **Pros and Cons**: High sensitivity for central lesions; expensive and time-consuming.

2. **Tilt Table Test (Non-invasive)**
   - **Urgency**: Moderate
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: Evaluate for orthostatic hypotension.
   - **Pros and Cons**: Can identify orthostatic hypotension; may cause discomfort.

3. **Electronystagmography (ENG) or Videonystagmography (VNG) (Non-invasive)**
   - **Urgency**: Moderate
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: Assess vestibular function.
   - **Pros and Cons**: Provides detailed vestibular function analysis; requires specialized equipment.
