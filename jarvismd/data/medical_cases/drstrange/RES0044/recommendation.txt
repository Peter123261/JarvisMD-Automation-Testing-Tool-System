## Summary of Additional Recommendations

- Order a COVID-19 test.
- Consider a chest X-ray if symptoms persist or worsen.
- Evaluate for other respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, RSV).

## Things to Consider

- Further questions about recent travel or contact with sick individuals.
- Review patient's vaccination status, especially for influenza and COVID-19.
- Discuss preventive measures and isolation if COVID-19 is suspected.

## PRIMED Model Analysis

### P: 3–4 Probable Diagnoses

1. **COVID-19**
   - **Confidence %**: 70%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Dry cough, fever, fatigue, recent onset.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No loss of taste or smell, no shortness of breath.

2. **Viral Upper Respiratory Infection (URI)**
   - **Confidence %**: 60%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Dry cough, sore throat, fever.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No runny or stuffy nose, no wheezing.

3. **Influenza**
   - **Confidence %**: 50%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Fever, fatigue, dry cough.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No muscle aches, no chills or night sweats.

### R: Red Flag Conditions
- COVID-19
- Pneumonia
- Acute bronchitis

### I: Important Often-Missed Conditions
- Atypical pneumonia
- Pertussis

### M: Masquerades
- Allergic rhinitis
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

### E: Patient Expectations
- Rule out COVID-19.
- Relief from cough and associated symptoms.

### D: Diagnostic Clusters
- Fever, dry cough, fatigue (COVID-19, Influenza, Viral URI)

## Most Likely Diagnosis
   - **Name**: COVID-19
   - **Confidence %**: 70%
   - **Rationale**: The patient presents with a dry cough, fever, and fatigue, which are consistent with COVID-19. The absence of loss of taste or smell does not rule out COVID-19, as presentations can vary.

## Recommendations for Further Diagnostic Steps

1. **COVID-19 Test**
   - **Type**: Non-invasive (nasopharyngeal swab)
   - **Urgency**: Immediate
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: High index of suspicion due to symptoms and current pandemic.
   - **Pros and Cons**: Quick diagnosis, but false negatives can occur.

2. **Chest X-ray**
   - **Type**: Non-invasive
   - **Urgency**: If symptoms persist or worsen
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: Rule out pneumonia or other complications.
   - **Pros and Cons**: Can identify complications, but involves radiation exposure.

3. **Influenza Test**
   - **Type**: Non-invasive (nasopharyngeal swab)
   - **Urgency**: If COVID-19 test is negative
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: Similar presentation to COVID-19.
   - **Pros and Cons**: Quick diagnosis, but may not change management if symptoms are mild.
