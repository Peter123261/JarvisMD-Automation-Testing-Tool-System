## Summary of Additional Recommendations

- Order a urine culture to confirm the diagnosis and guide antibiotic therapy.
- Consider a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy, given the patient's age and sexual activity.
- Advise the patient to avoid irritants such as caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods, which can exacerbate urinary symptoms.

## Things to Consider

- Further questions about any recent travel or new sexual partners.
- Review of any recent antibiotic use that might affect current treatment.
- Preventive care opportunities such as discussing safe sex practices and regular STD screening.

## PRIMED Model Analysis

### P: 3–4 Probable Diagnoses
1. **Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)**
   - **Confidence %**: 85%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Dysuria, lower abdominal pain, hematuria, foul-smelling urine.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No fever, no increased frequency of urination.

2. **Interstitial Cystitis**
   - **Confidence %**: 50%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Dysuria, lower abdominal pain.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No chronic symptoms, no history of similar episodes.

3. **Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI)**
   - **Confidence %**: 40%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Dysuria, sexually active, no recent STD screening.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No discharge, no systemic symptoms.

### R: Red Flag Conditions
- Pyelonephritis (to be excluded if symptoms worsen or if fever develops)
- Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)

### I: Important Often-Missed Conditions
- Vaginitis
- Urethritis

### M: Masquerades
- Early pregnancy
- Gastrointestinal issues (e.g., IBS exacerbation)

### E: Patient Expectations
- Relief from urinary symptoms
- Understanding of the cause of symptoms
- Guidance on sexual activity during treatment

### D: Diagnostic Clusters
- Dysuria, hematuria, lower abdominal pain (suggestive of UTI)
- Dysuria, lower abdominal pain, sexually active (suggestive of STI)

## Most Likely Diagnosis
- **Name**: Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)
- **Confidence %**: 85%
- **Rationale**: The patient's symptoms of dysuria, lower abdominal pain, hematuria, and foul-smelling urine are highly indicative of a UTI. The absence of fever and systemic symptoms makes pyelonephritis less likely at this stage.

## Recommendations for Further Diagnostic Steps

1. **Urine Culture**
   - **Type**: Non-invasive
   - **Urgency**: Immediate
   - **Considerations**: Helps confirm the diagnosis and guide antibiotic therapy.
   - **Pros**: Accurate identification of the causative organism.
   - **Cons**: Takes time for results.

2. **Pregnancy Test**
   - **Type**: Non-invasive
   - **Urgency**: Immediate
   - **Considerations**: Important to rule out pregnancy given the patient's age and sexual activity.
   - **Pros**: Quick and easy to perform.
   - **Cons**: None significant.

3. **STD Screening**
   - **Type**: Non-invasive
   - **Urgency**: Within the next week
   - **Considerations**: Given the patient's sexual activity and lack of recent screening.
   - **Pros**: Identifies potential co-existing infections.
   - **Cons**: May cause anxiety for the patient.
