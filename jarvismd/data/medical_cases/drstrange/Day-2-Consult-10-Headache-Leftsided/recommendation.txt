## Summary of Additional Recommendations

- Consider ordering a brain MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities.
- Evaluate for potential medication overuse headache if the patient has been using analgesics frequently.
- Assess for other secondary causes of headache, such as sinusitis or temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders.

## Things to Consider

- Further questions about the frequency and duration of previous headaches.
- Review the patient's use of caffeine and other stimulants.
- Discuss potential side effects and interactions of ibuprofen with sertraline.

## PRIMED Model Analysis

### P: 3–4 Probable Diagnoses
1. **Migraine**
   - **Confidence %**: 70%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Unilateral headache, sensitivity to light, history of anxiety.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No family history of migraines, no nausea or vomiting.
   
2. **Tension Headache**
   - **Confidence %**: 60%
   - **Supporting Findings**: History of anxiety, stress, and work-related pressure.
   - **Opposing Findings**: Unilateral pain, sensitivity to light (more typical of migraine).

3. **Cluster Headache**
   - **Confidence %**: 40%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Severe unilateral headache, early morning onset.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No autonomic symptoms (e.g., tearing, nasal congestion), no history of similar headaches.

### R: Red Flag Conditions
- Intracranial hemorrhage
- Brain tumor
- Meningitis

### I: Important Often-Missed Conditions
- Medication overuse headache
- Sinusitis
- TMJ disorders

### M: Masquerades
- Sinusitis
- TMJ disorders

### E: Patient Expectations
- Relief from severe headache
- Understanding the cause of the headache
- Effective management plan

### D: Diagnostic Clusters
- Unilateral headache, sensitivity to light, history of anxiety (suggestive of migraine)
- Severe headache, early morning onset (suggestive of cluster headache)

## Most Likely Diagnosis
- **Name**: Migraine
- **Confidence %**: 70%
- **Rationale**: The patient's symptoms of unilateral headache and sensitivity to light, combined with a history of anxiety and stress, are most consistent with a migraine. The absence of nausea and vomiting slightly lowers the confidence but does not rule out the diagnosis.

## Recommendations for Further Diagnostic Steps

1. **Brain MRI**
   - **Type**: Non-invasive
   - **Urgency**: Moderate (within the next few weeks)
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: Rule out structural abnormalities.
   - **Pros and Cons**: High sensitivity for detecting structural causes; expensive and may require referral.

2. **Medication Overuse Assessment**
   - **Type**: Clinical evaluation
   - **Urgency**: During follow-up visit
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: Evaluate the frequency of analgesic use.
   - **Pros and Cons**: Simple and non-invasive; requires detailed patient history.

3. **Sinus and TMJ Evaluation**
   - **Type**: Clinical examination and possibly imaging (e.g., sinus X-ray)
   - **Urgency**: During follow-up visit
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: Rule out secondary causes of headache.
   - **Pros and Cons**: Can identify treatable causes; may require additional referrals.
