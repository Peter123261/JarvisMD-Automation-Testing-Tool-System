## Summary of Additional Recommendations

- Order a COVID-19 test.
- Consider a chest X-ray if symptoms persist or worsen.
- Monitor oxygen saturation levels.

## Things to Consider

- Further questions about any recent changes in school environment or exposure to new allergens.
- Review of any over-the-counter medications or home remedies being used.
- Preventive care opportunities such as flu vaccination if not already done.

## PRIMED Model Analysis

### P: 3–4 Probable Diagnoses

1. **Viral Upper Respiratory Infection (URI)**
   - **Confidence %**: 70%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Dry cough, fever, runny nose, fatigue, recent onset.
   - **Opposing Findings**: None significant.

2. **COVID-19**
   - **Confidence %**: 60%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Fever, dry cough, potential loss of taste, school exposure.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No confirmed contact with COVID-19 positive individuals.

3. **Influenza**
   - **Confidence %**: 50%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Fever, fatigue, cough, runny nose.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No chills or night sweats, no confirmed flu exposure.

### R: Red Flag Conditions
- Pneumonia
- Acute Bronchitis
- Asthma exacerbation

### I: Important Often-Missed Conditions
- Mycoplasma pneumonia
- Pertussis

### M: Masquerades
- Allergic rhinitis
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

### E: Patient Expectations
- Concern about COVID-19 and potential school exposure.
- Desire for symptom relief and reassurance.

### D: Diagnostic Clusters
- Fever, cough, fatigue, runny nose (suggestive of viral infection).

## Most Likely Diagnosis
- **Viral Upper Respiratory Infection (URI)**
- **Confidence %**: 70%
- **Rationale**: The combination of dry cough, fever, runny nose, and fatigue with no significant red flag symptoms strongly suggests a viral URI.

## Recommendations for Further Diagnostic Steps

1. **COVID-19 Test**
   - **Type**: Non-invasive (nasal swab)
   - **Urgency**: Immediate
   - **Considerations**: High community transmission rates, school exposure.
   - **Pros**: Quick, definitive diagnosis.
   - **Cons**: Potential for false negatives.

2. **Chest X-ray**
   - **Type**: Non-invasive
   - **Urgency**: If symptoms persist or worsen
   - **Considerations**: Rule out pneumonia or other serious lung conditions.
   - **Pros**: Detailed lung imaging.
   - **Cons**: Radiation exposure.

3. **Oxygen Saturation Monitoring**
   - **Type**: Non-invasive (pulse oximetry)
   - **Urgency**: Immediate
   - **Considerations**: Assess for hypoxia.
   - **Pros**: Quick, non-invasive.
   - **Cons**: None significant.
