## Summary of Additional Recommendations

- Order an ECG immediately to assess for any acute cardiac events.
- Obtain cardiac biomarkers (e.g., troponin) to evaluate for myocardial infarction.
- Consider a chest X-ray to rule out other potential causes of chest pain such as pneumothorax or rib fractures.

## Things to Consider

- Further questions about the exact nature of the chest pain (e.g., radiation to jaw or arm).
- Review medication interactions, especially considering the patient's use of crystal meth.
- Preventive care opportunities, such as smoking cessation and substance abuse counseling.

## PRIMED Model Analysis

### P: 3–4 Probable Diagnoses

1. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)**
   - **Confidence %**: 80%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Sudden onset of chest pain, pain worsened by exertion, history of high cholesterol and hypertension, smoking history.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No radiation of pain to other areas.

2. **Musculoskeletal Pain (e.g., Costochondritis)**
   - **Confidence %**: 60%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Recent physical activity (shoveling), pain localized to one area, worsened by movement.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No history of trauma directly to the chest.

3. **Pneumothorax**
   - **Confidence %**: 50%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Sudden onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, history of recent trauma (rugby).
   - **Opposing Findings**: No significant findings on physical exam indicating pneumothorax.

### R: Red Flag Conditions
- Acute Myocardial Infarction
- Pulmonary Embolism
- Aortic Dissection

### I: Important Often-Missed Conditions
- Pulmonary Embolism
- Pericarditis

### M: Masquerades
- Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)
- Anxiety/Panic Attack

### E: Patient Expectations
- Relief from chest pain
- Understanding the cause of symptoms

### D: Diagnostic Clusters
- Chest pain, shortness of breath, history of hypertension and high cholesterol.

## Most Likely Diagnosis
- **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)**
- **Confidence %**: 80%
- **Rationale**: The patient's presentation of sudden onset chest pain, exacerbated by exertion, with a history of hypertension, high cholesterol, and smoking, strongly suggests ACS.

## Recommendations for Further Diagnostic Steps

1. **ECG (Non-invasive)**
   - **Urgency**: Immediate
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: High risk for cardiac events.
   - **Pros and Cons**: Quick, non-invasive, essential for diagnosing ACS.

2. **Cardiac Biomarkers (e.g., Troponin) (Invasive)**
   - **Urgency**: Immediate
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: High risk for myocardial infarction.
   - **Pros and Cons**: Essential for confirming myocardial damage, requires blood draw.

3. **Chest X-ray (Non-invasive)**
   - **Urgency**: As soon as possible
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: Rule out other causes of chest pain.
   - **Pros and Cons**: Non-invasive, can identify pneumothorax or rib fractures.
