## Summary of Additional Recommendations

- Order an ECG and cardiac enzymes immediately.
- Consider a chest X-ray to rule out pneumothorax or other pulmonary causes.
- Initiate oxygen therapy if SpO2 is below 94%.

## Things to Consider

- Further questions about the quality and pattern of the chest pain.
- Medication interactions, especially if any new medications are started.
- Preventive care opportunities, such as smoking cessation counseling.

## PRIMED Model Analysis

### P: 3–4 Probable Diagnoses

1. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)**
   - **Confidence %**: 70%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Sharp chest pain, constant pain, exacerbated by lying down, family history of heart attack, lightheadedness, trouble breathing, and palpitations.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No radiation of pain, no nausea or vomiting.

2. **Pericarditis**
   - **Confidence %**: 60%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Sharp chest pain, worse when lying down, relieved by sitting up, recent physical activity (moving furniture).
   - **Opposing Findings**: No recent infection or fever.

3. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)**
   - **Confidence %**: 50%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Sharp chest pain, trouble breathing, lightheadedness, history of smoking.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No immobilization, no recent surgery or trauma, no hemoptysis.

4. **Musculoskeletal Pain**
   - **Confidence %**: 40%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Recent physical activity (moving furniture), sharp pain.
   - **Opposing Findings**: Lightheadedness, trouble breathing, palpitations.

### R: Red Flag Conditions

- Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)
- Pulmonary Embolism
- Aortic Dissection

### I: Important Often-Missed Conditions

- Pericarditis
- Pneumothorax

### M: Masquerades

- Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)
- Anxiety/Panic Attack

### E: Patient Expectations

- The patient likely expects a thorough evaluation to rule out serious conditions like a heart attack.

### D: Diagnostic Clusters

- Chest pain, trouble breathing, lightheadedness, palpitations.

## Most Likely Diagnosis

- **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)**
- **Confidence %**: 70%
- **Rationale**: The combination of sharp, constant chest pain, exacerbation by lying down, family history of heart attack, and associated symptoms like lightheadedness and trouble breathing strongly suggest ACS.

## Recommendations for Further Diagnostic Steps

1. **ECG and Cardiac Enzymes**
   - **Test Type**: Non-invasive
   - **Urgency**: Immediate
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: High risk of ACS, family history of heart attack.
   - **Pros and Cons**: Quick and essential for diagnosing ACS; no significant cons.

2. **Chest X-ray**
   - **Test Type**: Non-invasive
   - **Urgency**: Immediate
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: Rule out pneumothorax or other pulmonary causes.
   - **Pros and Cons**: Quick and non-invasive; limited in diagnosing cardiac conditions.

3. **D-dimer Test**
   - **Test Type**: Non-invasive
   - **Urgency**: Immediate
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: Rule out pulmonary embolism.
   - **Pros and Cons**: Useful for ruling out PE; false positives can occur.
