## Summary of Additional Recommendations

- Consider ordering a brain MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities.
- Evaluate for potential medication overuse headache given recent frequent use of painkillers.
- Discuss lifestyle modifications and stress management techniques to potentially reduce headache frequency.

## Things to Consider

- Assess for potential interactions between Microgynon and any prescribed medications.
- Evaluate the patient's hydration status and recommend adequate fluid intake.
- Consider preventive care opportunities such as regular exercise and stress management techniques.

## PRIMED Model Analysis

### P: 3–4 Probable Diagnoses
1. **Migraine**
   - **Confidence**: 85%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Unilateral throbbing headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, visual aura (zigzag lines).
   - **Opposing Findings**: None significant.

2. **Tension-Type Headache**
   - **Confidence**: 50%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Headache worsens with movement, stress-related.
   - **Opposing Findings**: Unilateral location, presence of visual aura, nausea, and vomiting.

3. **Medication Overuse Headache**
   - **Confidence**: 40%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Recent frequent use of painkillers.
   - **Opposing Findings**: No history of chronic headache or overuse pattern established.

### R: Red Flag Conditions
- Brain tumor
- Meningitis
- Subarachnoid hemorrhage

### I: Important Often-Missed Conditions
- Cluster headache
- Sinusitis

### M: Masquerades
- Cervical spine disorders
- Temporomandibular joint disorders

### E: Patient Expectations
- The patient is concerned about the possibility of a brain tumor due to personal and family history.

### D: Diagnostic Clusters
- Headache, visual aura, nausea, vomiting, photophobia.

## Most Likely Diagnosis
- **Migraine**
- **Confidence**: 85%
- **Rationale**: The patient's symptoms of unilateral throbbing headache, visual aura, nausea, vomiting, and photophobia are highly indicative of a migraine.

## Recommendations for Further Diagnostic Steps

1. **Brain MRI**
   - **Type**: Non-invasive
   - **Urgency**: Moderate (within the next few weeks)
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: Rule out structural abnormalities, especially given the patient's concern about brain tumors.
   - **Pros and Cons**: High sensitivity for detecting structural issues; expensive and may cause anxiety.

2. **Headache Diary**
   - **Type**: Non-invasive
   - **Urgency**: Immediate
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: Helps identify triggers and patterns.
   - **Pros and Cons**: Low cost, non-invasive; requires patient compliance.

3. **Neurological Examination**
   - **Type**: Non-invasive
   - **Urgency**: Immediate
   - **Patient-specific considerations**: Assess for any subtle neurological deficits.
   - **Pros and Cons**: Quick and non-invasive; may not detect all issues.
