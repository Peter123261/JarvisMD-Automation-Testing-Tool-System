### 1. Summary of Additional Recommendations

- Consider ordering a brain MRI to rule out secondary causes of headache.
- Evaluate for potential medication overuse headache.
- Assess for signs of increased intracranial pressure.

### 2. Things to Consider

- Further questions about any recent changes in sleep patterns or diet.
- Review any over-the-counter medications or supplements the patient might be taking.
- Preventive care opportunities: lifestyle modifications to reduce headache triggers.

### 3. PRIMED Model Analysis

**P: 3–4 Probable Diagnoses**
1. **Migraine**
   - **Confidence %**: 75%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Family history of migraines, photophobia, headache worsening over days, throbbing pain.
   - **Opposing Findings**: Lack of previous personal history of migraines.

2. **Tension-Type Headache**
   - **Confidence %**: 50%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Dull pain, stress at work, no nausea or vomiting.
   - **Opposing Findings**: Photophobia, pain around the eye.

3. **Cluster Headache**
   - **Confidence %**: 40%
   - **Supporting Findings**: Pain around the right eye, severe intensity.
   - **Opposing Findings**: Duration of headache (3 days), lack of autonomic symptoms.

**R: Red Flag Conditions**
- Intracranial mass or lesion
- Meningitis
- Subarachnoid hemorrhage

**I: Important Often-Missed Conditions**
- Medication overuse headache
- Sinusitis

**M: Masquerades**
- Sinus headache
- Cervicogenic headache

**E: Patient Expectations**
- Relief from headache pain
- Avoidance of chronic migraine diagnosis

**D: Diagnostic Clusters**
- Headache, photophobia, family history of migraines

### 4. Most Likely Diagnosis
**Migraine**
- **Confidence %**: 75%
- **Rationale**: The patient's symptoms, including photophobia, throbbing pain, and family history, strongly suggest a migraine. The lack of response to ibuprofen and the severity of the headache further support this diagnosis.

### 5. Recommendations for Further Diagnostic Steps

1. **Brain MRI**
   - **Type**: Non-invasive
   - **Urgency**: Moderate (within the next week)
   - **Considerations**: Rule out secondary causes such as intracranial mass or lesion.
   - **Pros**: High sensitivity for structural abnormalities.
   - **Cons**: Cost, potential for incidental findings.

2. **Medication Overuse Assessment**
   - **Type**: Clinical evaluation
   - **Urgency**: Immediate
   - **Considerations**: Evaluate the frequency and dosage of ibuprofen and other medications.
   - **Pros**: Identifies potential exacerbating factors.
   - **Cons**: Requires detailed patient history.

3. **Ophthalmologic Examination**
   - **Type**: Non-invasive
   - **Urgency**: Moderate (within the next week)
   - **Considerations**: Assess for any ocular causes of headache.
   - **Pros**: Rules out eye strain or other ocular issues.
   - **Cons**: May require referral to a specialist.
